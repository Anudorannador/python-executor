# learn skill

Extract reusable skills from any source: task files, chat history, or any data-producing operation.

## Trigger

Activate when user says:

- "learn skill"
- "save as skill"
- "distill skill"
- "extract skill"

## Input Sources

Skills can be extracted from:

- `temp/.history.jsonl` - Task execution history (auto-generated by pyx)
- `temp/` task files (scripts, manifests, logs)
- Chat conversation history
- Any operation that produced data/code
- User-provided code snippets or workflows

## Output Format: Claude SKILL Standard

```
<skill_name>/
├── SKILL.md           # Required: YAML frontmatter + markdown instructions
├── scripts/           # Optional: executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)
├── references/        # Optional: documentation loaded into context as needed
└── assets/            # Optional: templates, images, boilerplate for output
```

## Workflow

```
1. Identify source (files / chat / user input)
2. Summarize content (token-efficient)
3. Scan existing skills (headers ONLY)
4. Recommend action: create / merge / overwrite
5. Generate SKILL markdown
6. USER CONFIRMS -> then save
```
